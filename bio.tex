\maketitle

Rebecca Smethurst grew up in the North West of the UK were she first developed a love of astronomy; a passion which she took with her to Durham University where she received a first class degree in Physics with Astronomy (2012). After completing her degree, Rebecca started working in the British aerospace industry before finally releasing that astronomy was her true calling. In 2013 she started research for her PhD on galaxy evolution at the University of Oxford under the supervision of Prof. Chris Lintott. Here she worked closely with the Galaxy Zoo team utilising the public's classifications of galaxy shapes in astronomical survey images to statistically study the galaxy population. She was granted her DPhil in January 2017 after writing her thesis entitled: ``\emph{The influence of morphology, AGN and environment on the quenching histories of galaxies}.'' She was awarded the Sixty Symbols Research Fellowship at the University of Nottingham whilst completing her thesis, a post she has now held since January 2017. Rebecca has continued her galaxy evolution research at Nottingham whilst also writing and presenting videos for the popular YouTube channel Sixty Symbols.
